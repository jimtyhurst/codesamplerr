Snippets of R code for testing and demonstrating functionality available in R packages.

I keep this as a scratchpad for when I need to learn some feature or function. I don't expect other people to use this code, but I find it helpful to look back sometimes to see how a particular function works.

Sample code is either in the `tests/testthat` directory or the `R` directory.
